# Salary Prediction Model

This is a data analytics projects for creating data models that can predict salary using demographic features.  The dataset used for this project is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudheerp2147234/salary-dataset-based-on-country-and-race. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features, as well as missing values. The project uses python to clean and transform the dataset into a ready state for modeling. Visualizations are created using Python to show relevant information extracted from the dataset. Modeling is performed by splitting the dataset into a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset is used to train models and the testing dataset is used to test the accuracy of the trained model.
